Overview

This code provides implementation of multiple deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
The implementations are based on Tensorflow. I use OpenAI Gym as the RL environment.

DQN_Implementation.py:

The implementation code.
	content:
		Deep Q Network
		Linear Network
		Multilayer Perceptron
		Dueling Network
		Convolutional Neuro Network
		Experience Replay

	note:
		You can change the ENVIRONMENT_NAME to test the algorithms on different evironment.
		You can set different network as the approximate function of the Q network.
		CNN is only used for raw image environment of Atari games.

plot.py:

The auxiliary script to parse the log and plot the performance.
You can save the print log as a log file and run the script to generate the performance plot.
